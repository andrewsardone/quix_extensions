Quix Extensions
===============

The `commands.txt` file holds my extensions to the [Quix extensible bookmarklet](http://quixapp.com/).

To extend the bookmarklet, I grabbed the raw url to `commands.txt` and linked to it on the Quix [extend page](http://quixapp.com/extend/).

Example: SelectorGadget
-----------------------

The first command I added was `sg` to activate [SelectorGadget](http://www.selectorgadget.com/), a handy point and click CSS selectors utility.
